Just a bunch of code for messing around with a LED board.


This is not:
- a good example of commiting files (no descriptive names, no separate fixes/features).
- a good represenative of code quality (the project was starting during the early part of learning coding).

This is:
- a great example of why you need a plan going into projects.
- an excellent reason of why project layout is important.

A refactor would be a *very* good idea. 
However, it's not a fun task, and motivation is usually put towards creating more of this mess.
In the future, it's possible that this will be remade properly, but it would be in a new repo.
